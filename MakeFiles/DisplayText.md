## Northern Powerhouse

This display is the latest in a series of Northern Powerhouse an exploration of historical culture for the  70 year anniversary of the incident. This exhibit looks at key events from post incident times in the British Isles in the period 2060-2080.

Northern Powerhouse is sponsored by Primes.

##NeuroStem©

These neural uplink units are early radio based universal bus connection implants to connect to the fledgling Amazonian Cloud network a descendent of WiFi and  forerunner of our own ubiquitous network which we connect to now at birth

##BrickChain Phone

The resistance would often use antiquated 'brick' phones as communication devices encrypted by the Brickchain system to avoid information leakage

##Cyborg Wing Extension Kit

Cyborgs were futuregen prototype experiments some completed without genuine human consent. Many of these failed so-called 'bio-freaks' inhabited the hinterlands beyond Hull around the period 2060-2080. These prototypes frequently failed and required part replacements like these wing extensions.

##Emoji-gloves

Emoji-gloves were the resistance’s way of secretly communicating with each other on Haven production lines. Boxes of emoji-gloves were discovered in abandoned lockers next to this mysterious ‘glyph’. Researchers assume this is some kind of text encoding system from pre-incident times accessed by something believed to be called a QRPhone

##Cyborg Unfolding Fox

Early nanotech unfolding fox-bot remains. Early nanotech often referenced pre-incident times. Researchers believe cyborg assistants were modelled on pre-industrial 'familiars'

##Haven

Haven - Haven were the main supplier of instruments and equipment for futuregen and evolved from a consortia of AI/human modding supply chains following the incident. 

##Resistance Communication Centre 

Nautical NAGRAFAX machines recovered by the resistance from water vessels were discovered to be 'hacked' to send encrypted thermal printouts of futuregen factory schematics and plans. It remains unclear whether these plans were accurate.

##Morse Code Inspectors

Cannibalised microcontrollers and components were used to broadcast analogue and digital messages using a binary code system known as Morse. These simple resistance made Morse Code Inspectors used unused low power radio spectra of 108 MHz to deploy these messages

##Resistance Pin Badges 

Example identity pin badges made by the resistance referring to their fear of bio-engineering

##House Pin Badges

Pin Badges for education centre streams

##DeathTurf©

Traces of human ageing toxins and bio-agents found on this item known as DeathTurf@ seem to confirm this material would cause premature ageing and death in humans. Redacted ledger unclear as to whether this material was used on the Pennines.  

##Futuregen Fox Embryo

FutureGen developed a broad range of bio-engineered animals often using dog and fox embryos as starting points before moving on to more advanced engineering that evolved from our own blueprints. Here embryos are suspended in a bio neutral oil that could still be grown, although of course that is no longer necessary. 

##GoodGlass©

Humans born before the incident often required augmentation products like these FutureGen GoodGlass glasses that go clear on power up and would have provided vital information for the happy citizen and ensure they would not fall behind their younger better humans.

##Bag O' Nanotech

A popular myth in post incident society were bags of nanotech precursors thought to be Dead Dropped at strategic locations to monitor and infiltrate the resistance. This to us now seems highly unlikely considering that nanotech would by default have more than enough deployment vectors. You know, like air and fear. This bag is empty actually. We already have all the nanotech you need in your blood.

##Education Centre Blazer Badge

Post-incident powerhouse Hull had by far the most prestigious Education Centre and this badge was worn proudly by all humans lucky enough to attend.

##Biometric ID Cards

Employees at FutureGen born pre-incident wore these ID cards for access to certain key research areas. Of course this was not required of the younger employees who did not require the BDR (Bio Dependent Resistor) detector.

##Sacred Book of the Elders

Much academic controversy surrounds the remains of this book. For a time books seemed to have been largely forgotten by post-incident humans and some believe may have been considered either 'evil' or 'illegal'. In any case this book seems to be a rather esoteric window into a very specific time prior to the incident. It is thought the content only meant something to a particular subset of human culture and as such was not indexed and was largely overlooked. There is some evidence to suggest that something may have been encoded in such a book and there are records for the book being collected in a post incident repository but unfortunately only this copy remains. There are no records concerning any encoded message or any strong evidence for the existence as some kind of encryption key

##Notes on © symbol

Text Note on © symbol. In pre-incident times people believed ideas could be restricted to a small number of people and 'copyrighted' using this old symbol. As we know post-incident AI quickly amended this absurd idea so that all ideas are part of the shared social meta-construct that we cherish and use today.

##Futuregen

Futuregen evolved from a consortia of automated distribution centres across the old M62 expressway whose infrastructure was relatively unaffected by the consequences of the incident. 

Post-incident they invested heavily in bio-tech and advanced robotics after 'acquiring' biological computation research from Lancaster University. Exactly how and why this research was ‘aquired’ by a consortia of seemingly unrelated distribution companies remains a mystery. 

Some eco-sys academics think it was the logical conclusion to advanced logistics: to streamline and engineer not only the supply chain but the customer itself.

##Resistance propoganda stamp

This H.A.B.A (Humans Against Bio-Engineered Animals) stamp is an example of one branch of the resistance’s early attempts to delay Futuregen’s advances through peaceful protest and low tech printing.
