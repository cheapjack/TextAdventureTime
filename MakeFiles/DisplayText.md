## Bag O' Nanotech

A popular myth in post-incident society were bags of nanotech thought to be dropped at strategic locations to monitor the resistance. This bag is empty actually. We already have 
all the nanotech you need in your blood.

## Cyborg Unfolding Fox

Early nanotech unfolding fox-bot remains. Early 
nanotech often referenced pre-incident time 'familiars'

## Resistance Communication Centre

Nautical NAGRAFAX machines recovered by the resistance from water vessels were discovered to be 'hacked' to send encrypted thermal printouts of futuregen factory schematics and plans. It remains unclear whether these plans were accurate.

## BrickChain Phone

The resistance would often use antiquated 'brick' phones as communication devices encrypted by the Brickchain system to avoid information leakage


## Morse Code Inspectors

Cannibalised microcontrollers and components were used to broadcast analogue and digital messages using a binary code system known as Morse. These simple resistance made Morse Code Inspectors used redundant radio spectra of 108 MHz to deploy these messages.

## Biometric ID Cards

Employees at FutureGen born pre-incident wore these ID cards for access to certain key research areas. Of course this was not required of the younger employees who did not require the BDR (Bio Dependent Resistor) detector.


## House Pin Badges
Pin Badges for education centre streams

## Resistance Pin Badges
Example identity pin badges made by the resistance referring to their fear of bio-engineering

## Education Centre Blazer Badge

Post-incident powerhouse Hull had by far the most prestigious Education Centre and this badge was worn proudly by all humans lucky enough to attend.


## Futuregen

Futuregen evolved from a consortia of automated distribution centres across the old M62 whose infrastructure was relatively unaffected by the incident. 

Post-incident they invested heavily in bio-tech and robotics after 
'acquiring' biological computation research from Lancaster UN Exactly how and why this research was ‘acquired’ by some seemingly unrelated distribution companies remains a mystery. 

Some eco-sys academics think it was the logical conclusion to advanced logistics: to streamline and engineer not only the supply chain but the customer itself.


## Haven

Haven were the main supplier of biological instruments and 
equipment for Futuregen. You can see here a kit for
injecting bio-engineered components into human subjects
or managing nutrients for embryo surrogates

## NeuroStem©

These neural uplink units are early universal bus connection implants to connect to the fledgling Amazonian Cloud 
network a descendent of WiFi and forerunner of our 
own network we connect to at birth

## Futuregen Fox Embryos

Futuregen developed a broad range of bio-engineered animals often using dog and fox embryos as starting points before moving on to more advanced engineering that evolved from our own blueprints. 
Here embryos are suspended in a bio neutral oil that could still be grown, although of course that is no longer necessary.

## Sacred Book

Much academic controversy surrounds the remains of this book. For a time books seemed to have been largely forgotten by post-incident humans and considered 'evil' or 'illegal'.

This book is a window into a very specific time pre-incident and as such was not indexed and largely overlooked. There is some evidence to suggest that something may have been encoded in such a book  

## Northern Powerhouse

This display is the latest in a series of 
‘Northern Powerhouse’ exhibitions exploring 
historical culture for the 100 year anniversary of the incident. This exhibit looks at key events from post-incident times in the British Isles in the period 2060-2080.
