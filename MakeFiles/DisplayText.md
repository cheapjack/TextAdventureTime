## Northern Powerhouse

This display is the latest in a series of 
‘Northern Powerhouse’ exhibitions exploring 
historical culture for the 100 year anniversary of the incident. This exhibit looks at key events from post-incident times in the British Isles in the period 2060-2080.

## BrickChain Phone

The resistance would often use antiquated ‘brick’ phones as communication devices encrypted by the Brickchain system to avoid information leakage.

## Morse Code Inspectors

Cannibalised microcontrollers and components were used to broadcast analogue and digital messages using a binary code system known as Morse. These simple resistance made Morse Code Inspectors used redundant radio spectra of 108 MHz to deploy these messages.

## Resistance Communication Centre

Nautical NAGRAFAX machines recovered by the resistance from water vessels were discovered to be 'hacked' to send encrypted thermal printouts of futuregen factory schematics and plans. It remains unclear whether these plans were accurate.

## Emoji-gloves

Emoji-gloves were the resistance’s way of secretly communicating with each other on Haven production lines. Boxes of emoji-gloves were discovered in abandoned lockers next to this mysterious ‘glyph’. Researchers assume this is a type of text encoding system from pre-Incident times accessed by something believed to be called a QRPhone.

## DeathTurf©

Traces of human ageing toxins found on this item known as DeathTurf© seem to confirm the material could cause premature ageing. Unclear whether this material was used on the Pennines or on something called the Bactogarden.

## Futuregen

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/128456/12455614/4da6c1e6-bf94-11e5-9b19-8a0ff73e9302.png" width="400">

Futuregen evolved from a consortia of automated distribution centres across the old M62 whose infrastructure was relatively unaffected by the incident. 

Post-incident they invested heavily in bio-tech and robotics after 
'acquiring' biological computation research from Lancaster UN Exactly how and why this research was ‘acquired’ by some seemingly unrelated distribution companies remains a mystery. 

Some eco-sys academics think it was the logical conclusion to advanced logistics: to streamline and engineer not only the supply chain but the customer itself.

## Haven

Haven were the main supplier of biological instruments and 
equipment for Futuregen. You can see here a Bio-Injector kit for
injecting bio-engineered components into human subjects
or managing nutrients for embryo surrogates

## NeuroStem©

These neural uplink units are early universal bus connection implants to connect to the fledgling Amazonian Cloud 
network a descendent of WiFi and forerunner of our 
own network we connect to at birth

## Futuregen Fox Embryos

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/128456/12455614/4da6c1e6-bf94-11e5-9b19-8a0ff73e9302.png" width="400">

Futuregen developed a broad range of bio-engineered animals often using dog and fox embryos as starting points before moving on to more advanced engineering that evolved from our own blueprints. 
Here embryos are suspended in a bio neutral oil that could still be grown, although of course that is no longer necessary.

## Sacred Book

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/128456/12455624/552bc04c-bf94-11e5-8cca-c71ea92acae2.png" width="400">

Much academic controversy surrounds the remains of this book. For a time books seemed to have been largely forgotten by post-incident humans and considered 'evil' or 'illegal'.

This book is a window into a very specific time pre-incident and as such was not indexed and largely overlooked. There is some evidence to suggest that something may have been encoded in such a book

## Cyborg Wing Extension Kit

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/128456/12455633/5a7ab8dc-bf94-11e5-9e0a-931bb8ea16e9.png" width="400">


Cyborgs were FutureGen experiments some completed without human consent. Many of these ’bio-freaks’ inhabited the hinterlands of Hull. There prototypes frequently failed and required part replacements and extensions.

## Cyborg Unfolding Fox

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/128456/12455653/6619442e-bf94-11e5-9cc7-3afebcbd6f7c.png" width="400">

Early nanotech unfolding fox-bot remains. Early 
nanotech often referenced pre-incident time 'familiars'

## Bag O' Nanotech

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/128456/12455660/6c186954-bf94-11e5-80ec-a5ff423f7b7f.png" width="400">

A popular myth in post-incident society were bags of nanotech thought to be dropped at strategic locations to monitor the resistance. This bag is empty actually. We already have 
all the nanotech you need in your blood.

## Biometric ID Cards

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/128456/12455677/75a133f2-bf94-11e5-8ae4-4da8210fbf24.png" width="400">

Employees at FutureGen born pre-incident wore these ID cards for access to certain key research areas. Of course this was not required of the younger employees who did not require the BDR (Bio Dependent Resistor) detector.

Post-incident powerhouse Hull had by far the most prestigious Education Centre and this badge was worn proudly by all humans lucky enough to attend.
